# 🚀 Antoine's Digital Portfolio

Welcome to the source code of my digital home. This repository houses my personal portfolio—a reflection of my journey as a **2nd-year Computer Engineering student at the University of Toronto** and my obsession with building tools that bridge the gap between complex engineering and intuitive user experiences.

## 🛠 The Tech Stack

I don't just write code; I architect systems. This site is built with:
* **Framework:** Next.js (App Router)
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS / SwiftUI-inspired aesthetics
* **Database/ORM:** Supabase & Drizzle
* **Deployment:** Vercel

## 🎨 Beyond the Code
Engineering is my discipline, but creativity is my fuel. My portfolio highlights:
* **Heartstrings Unplayed:** My upcoming trilingual poetry collection (English, French, Spanish) exploring themes of connection and self-expression.
* **Leadership:** My journey with **Scouts du Liban**, HMUN 2024 advising, and serving as a summer camp counselor.
* **Music:** When I’m not debugging Assembly on a **DE1-SoC**, I’m likely singing or playing guitar and piano.

## 📈 Current Focus
* **Education:** University of Toronto, Computer Engineering (Class of 2027).
* **Technical:** Implementing low-level interrupts and audio core functionality for hardware-software integration.
* **Professional:** Crafting a narrative that shows I'm more than just a coder.
